# TR-SAT Mission Control V3

TR-SAT Mission Control V3 is a local-first orbital intelligence platform designed for satellite propagation, resident space object tracking, and situational awareness visualization. 

Powered by TLE/GP-based SGP4 propagation and a CesiumJS 3D mission view, TR-SAT provides a comprehensive desktop console for orbital mechanics analytics without relying on external cloud processing.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **TLE/GP-Based SGP4 Propagation**: Mathematically propagates satellite positions based on Two-Line Element (TLE) and General Perturbation (GP) sets.
*   **Live TLE-Based Tracking**: Streams high-frequency (up to 5 Hz) orbital updates to the frontend using in-memory SGP4 physics and WebSocket connections.
*   **Conjunction Screening MVP**: Geometric close approach screening between primary targets and catalog objects to detect miss-distances.
*   **Mission Replay Timeline**: Scrub through pre-calculated SGP4-propagated states within a defined time window.
*   **All-Catalog Progressive Visualization**: Snapshot visualization capable of rendering thousands of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) simultaneously.
*   **Ground Station Visibility**: Compute relative azimuth, elevation, and range to determine which objects are geometrically visible from a given terrestrial observer location.
*   **Client-Side Export System**: Zero-latency exports of Ephemeris (CSV), Trajectories (CZML), Ground Tracks (GeoJSON), and Mission Reports.
*   **Mission Knowledge Assistant (AI)**: An integrated LLM agent for answering domain-specific orbital mechanics questions, built with a secure proxy architecture and strict guardrails.
*   **Space Environment Dashboard**: Analytical tool summarizing local RSO catalog by orbital regime, altitude, inclination, source, object type, and TLE staleness metrics. Note: Regime classification relies on approximate derived characteristics and is meant for situational awareness, not certified operational SSA.
*   **Phase 20 Research Mode**: Specialized endpoints and analytics for catalog-wide TLE reliability and age tracking.
*   **Phase 21 Advanced Research & SSA Suite**: Advanced historical TLE evolution, heuristic decay indicators, approximate geometric illumination awareness, and relative motion analysis.
*   **Local-First Architecture**: Powered by a local SQLite persistence layer for TLE ingestion, ensuring fast, offline-capable analysis.

> [!WARNING]
> **Never commit your `.env` file!** Always use `.env.example` as a template and keep credentials strictly local.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

TR-SAT operates as a decoupled monorepo:
*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Skyfield (SGP4 Astrodynamics), SQLAlchemy, SQLite.
*   **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Zustand, CesiumJS.

**How to capture clean screenshots:**
1. Run backend and frontend servers.
2. Put your browser in Fullscreen mode (F11).
3. Sync the `stations` group, search for `ISS`, and set it as active.
4. Update the orbit to draw the 3D trajectory.
5. Take `mission-console.png`.
6. Start Live Tracking and take `live-tracking.png`.
7. Load the Catalog Layer (limit 1000) and take `catalog-layer.png`.
8. Run a Conjunction Screening and take `conjunction-screening.png`.
9. Expand the Export System panel and take `export-system.png`.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

### One-Click Launch (Windows)
The easiest way to run TR-SAT Mission Control V3 is using the new unified interactive launcher or the provided quick shortcuts.

**Using the Unified Launcher:**
- Double-click `TR-SAT.bat`. This interactive menu lets you build or start the web app and desktop executable from one place.

**Using Quick Shortcuts:**
The quick shortcuts are still available in the root directory for convenience:
1. **Build the Application**: Double-click `TR-SAT-Build.bat`.
2. **Start the Application**: Double-click `TR-SAT-Start.bat`.
3. **App Window Mode**: Double-click `TR-SAT-App.bat`.

*Note: The underlying PowerShell scripts for these operations have been categorized into the `scripts/windows/` directory. The local SQLite runtime database is safely stored in the `data/` directory.*

### Native Desktop Application
You can compile TR-SAT into a standalone Windows Executable (`.exe`) using the included Electron + PyInstaller build pipeline.
See [Desktop App Packaging Guide](docs/desktop-app.md) for instructions on how to run `TR-SAT-Desktop-Build.bat` and locate the portable executable.

### Manual Development Mode
If you prefer running the separate dev servers:

1. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   py -3.12 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   py -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend interface will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

*See `docs/one-click-launch.md` for troubleshooting and requirements.*

## 🎬 Demo Workflow

A typical demonstration workflow follows these steps:
1. Start backend and frontend servers.
2. Confirm API is ONLINE via the top Status Bar.
3. Sync the `stations` catalog group via the Left Dock.
4. Search for `ISS` in the Catalog Search.
5. Set the ISS as the active object.
6. Click **Update State** and **Update Orbit** in the Telemetry Panel.
7. Start **Live Tracking** to observe the TLE-derived state estimate in real-time.
8. Load the **Catalog Layer** snapshot to visualize the surrounding space environment.
9. Run a **Conjunction Screening** to geometrically evaluate miss-distances with nearby objects.
10. Check **Ground Station Visibility** to identify which objects are currently above the local horizon.
11. Query the **Mission Knowledge Assistant** to demonstrate AI-driven educational insights with strict scientific boundary constraints.
12. Use the **Data Export System** to download the Ephemeris (CSV), Trajectory (CZML), and the Turkish Mission Report.

For detailed steps, refer to `docs/demo-workflow.md`.

## 🔬 Scientific Model & Terminology

TR-SAT Mission Control adheres to strict scientific terminology regarding its capabilities.

*   **SGP4 Propagation**: The system uses the SGP4 analytical propagator to compute geocentric position and velocity states at any given UTC epoch based on public TLE/GP data.
*   **Geometric Close Approach Screening**: Conjunction screening is purely a geometric miss-distance evaluation between SGP4 propagated states.

### ⚠️ Limitations
*   **Not Direct Telemetry**: Live tracking is based on the latest available TLE/GP elements and UTC-time SGP4 propagation. It is *not* direct spacecraft telemetry or radar tracking.
*   **Not Collision Probability**: The system does *not* compute probability of collision (Pc). Public TLE/GP data does not include the covariance matrices required for precise collision probability.
*   **Visibility Conditions**: This is elevation-based geometric visibility. It does not guarantee optical brightness or naked-eye visibility, which depend on illumination, weather, and local sky conditions.
*   **Not Certified Ephemeris**: CZML exports and ephemeris outputs are intended for visualization and situational awareness, not as certified operational ephemeris for mission command.
*   **AI Guardrails**: The Mission Knowledge Assistant is informational only; it refuses to provide operational commands or simulate direct operational telemetry.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Cesium Ion (Visual Quality)
TR-SAT Mission Control uses a fallback offline-capable 3D globe by default. To enable high-resolution terrain and satellite imagery:
1. Obtain a free [Cesium Ion](https://cesium.com/ion/) token.
2. Place the token in `frontend/.env` as `VITE_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN="your_token_here"`.
3. The visual quality improvement depends on the selected imagery/terrain provider linked to your Ion account.
4. **Important**: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Future integration of covariance matrices for Pc calculation.
- Dockerization and cloud deployment manifests.
- Support for OPM/OEM ephemeris standard formats.

## 📄 License
To be selected before public release. This project is currently for academic and personal portfolio demonstration.
